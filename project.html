    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p><br>
    <p>
        The usual Scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your
        choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. The procedure is 
        repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence choices your final state is a goal state. If 
        you didn't, it isn't.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree, the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that
        the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its 
        children to move to and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking you most recent choice, 
        and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of option, revoke the choice that got you here, and try
        another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no option left, there are no good leaves to be found.
    </p><br>

    <img src="Image_root.png">

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Starting at Root, your opinion are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no option left to try. Go back to floot.</li>
        <li>At root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your opnion are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congralulations!</li>
    </ol><br>

        <p>
            
            In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could
            make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we
            have. [If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching].

        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>The backtracking algorithm</h2>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">
        <pre>
            boolean solve(Node n) {
                if n is a leaf node {
                    if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                    else return false
                }else{
                    for each child c of n {
                        if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                    }
                    return false
                }
            }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color:rgb(227, 224, 224);">
        <p>
            Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is Essential to understanding the algorithm. If 
            solve(n) is true, that means node is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to
            some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path includes n to any goal node.

        </p>
    </div>

    <strong>How does this work</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>If any child of n solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul><br>

    <p>
        Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any
        child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this is done by thr lines.
    </p>
    
    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">
        <pre>
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node, reurn true
                else return false
            }
        </pre>
    </div><br>

    <p>
        The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:
    </p><br>

    <strong><ul>
        <li>To search a tree:</li>
    </ul></strong>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>If the tree consists of a single keaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, seacrh the subtrees untill you find one containing a goal node, or until you have
            searched them all unsuccessfully.
        </li>
    </ol><br>

    <strong>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</strong>

    <div>
        <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact,
            that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">
        <pre>
            boolean solve(node n) {
                put node n on the stack;
                while the stack is not empty {
                    if the node at the top of the stack has untired children
                    push the next untried child onto the stack
                    else pop it off the stack
                }
                else{
                    if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                        push the next untried child onto the stack
                    else pop the node off the stack
                }
            }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        Starting from the root, the only nodes can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the 
        stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence the nodes on the stack at all time describes a valid path in the 
        tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore,
        if the node gets removed (making the stack empty), ther must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the 
        problem.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack from(in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal
        node.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of
        recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by(for instance) printing the node 
        at the current level, or storing it in an array.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print(in reverse order) the nodes along successfull path:
    </p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">
        <pre>
            boolean solve(node n) {
                if n is a leaf node {
                    if the leaf is a goal node {
                        print n 
                        return true
                    }
                    else return false
                }else{
                    for each child c of n {
                        if solve (c) succeeds {
                            print n 
                            return true
                        }
                    }
                    return false
                }
            }
        </pre>
    </div><br>

    <strong>Keeping backtracking simple</strong>

    <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty
        cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:
    </p><br>

    <p>
        for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmates and stalement
        solutions
    </p><br>
    
    <p>
        To keep the program clean, therefore, test like this should be burried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test 
        whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b>gameOver method</b>(or you could even call it <b>isLeaf</b>). This method would encapsulate all the 
        ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Notice that the backtracking algorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have
        been tried already (so we don't to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying <b>for each child
        c of n</b>. In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step thorough 
        them. In chess, for example, a node can repersent one arrangement of peices on a chessboard, and each child of that node can 
        represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track
        of which ones you've already examined?
    </p><br>

    <p>
        The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the 
        node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When
        the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure". This is a simple approach, but it may require
        quite a lot of additional work.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an
        ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        For example, you might be able to number the <b>children 1 through n</b>, and try them in numerical order. Then if you have just tried
        <b>child k</b>, you know that you have already tried children 1 through <b>k-1</b>, and you have not yet tried children <b>k+1</b> through <b>n</b>. Or, if you
        are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try <b>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue</b>. If child yellow fails,
        you know to try child green nex. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right <b>(or perhaps
        north, east, south, west).</b>
    </p><br>

    <p>
        It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. <b>In the chess game example,</b> you might number your
        pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order, but in addition each piece may also have several
        moves, and these must also be ordered.
    </p><br>

    <strong>Example: Tree Search</strong>
    <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the 
        simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point
        to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child.
        All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this not
        part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The 
        first example in this paper (which we repeat here ) shows a binary tree.
    </p><br>

    <p>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">
        <pre>
            public class BinaryTree{
                BinaryTree leftChild=null;
                BinaryTree rightChild=null;
                boolean isGoalNode=false;
                String name;


                BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
                    this.name = name;
                    leftChild =left;
                    rightChild = right;
                    this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
                }
            }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which contructs the above binary tree.</p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">
        <pre>
            static BinaryTree makeTree() {
                BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;
                c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);
                d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false);
                e = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, true);
                f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false);
                a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
                b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false);
                root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false);
                return root;
            }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it.</p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">
        <pre>
            public static void main(String[]args) {
                BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
                System.out.println(solvable(tree));
            }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a gaol node.</p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">
        <pre>
            static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
                /* 1 */ if (node== null) return false;
                /* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
                /* 3 */ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
                /* 4 */ if(solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
                /* 5 */ return false;
            }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p>Here's what numbered lines are doing:</p>
    <p>
        1. If we are given a full node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method wih the children of a node, without
        first checking whether those children actually exist.
    </p>

    <p>
        2. If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.
    </p>

    <p>
        3. See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line nodes is null is if node is non-null 
        and is not a goal node, says to
    </p>
 
    <p>
        4. Do the same thing for thing for the right child.
    </p>

    <p>
        5. Since neither child of node is solvable, node itslef is not solvable.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An
        alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur if they do. Here's that alternative version.
    </p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">
        <pre>
            static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {

                if (node.isGoalNode) return true;

                if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;

                if (node. rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightchild)) return true;

                return false;

            }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        I think the first version is simpler, but the second verson is more efficient.
    </p>

    <hr><br>

    <strong>What are the chiildren?</strong>

    <p>
        One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous 
        choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next, as far as you know, both the left and the 
        right child are possible solutions. In many problem, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without
        recursion.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter
        how conoulted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the 
        same color
    </p><br>

    <p>
        To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, untill all countries are 
        colored.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        There are two ways to do this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of countries,
                you have successfullycoloured the map.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a 
        checkerboard only needs two colors.
    </p><br>

<p>
<strong>boolean maplsOK()</strong><br>
Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.
</p>

<p>
<strong>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</strong><br>
Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.
</p>

    <p>
        <strong>int[] nextRoundAndColumn(int row, int column)</strong><br>
        Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next quare on the chexkboard).
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Here's the code for method 1:
    </p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">

    <p>
        The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of
        these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically estimates all of its descendents and this will
        often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically
        guaranted. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!

    <strong>Debugging techniques</strong>

    <p>
        Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometuimes we need to fail 
        back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be 
        applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.
    </p><br>

    <strong>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</strong><br>

    <p>
        Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably 
        want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what values it leaves with. However, if you just print a long
        list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with there corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can helpful.
    </p><br>

    <strong>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</strong><br>

    <p>
        Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itslef
        contain bugs or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs
        the proportions will be better.
    </p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">
        <pre>
            static String indent ="";

            static String name(BinaryTree node) {
                if(node == null) return null;
                else return node.name;
            }

            static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
                System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node)")");
                indent = indent + "| ";
            }
             
            static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
                indent = indent.substring(3);
                System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");
                return true;
            }
            static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
                indent = indent.subString(3);
                System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node)") return false");
                return false;
            }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:
    </p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">
        <pre>
            static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
                enter (node);
                if(node == null) return no(node);
                if(node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);
                if(solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node);
                return no(node);
            }
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>And we get these rsults:</p>
    <pre>
            Entering solvable(Root)
            |    Entering solvable(A)
            |    |    Entering solvable(C)
            |    |    |    Entering solvable(null)
            |    |    |    solvable(null) returns false
            |    |    |    Entering solvable(null)
            |    |    solvable(C) returns false
            |    |    Enering solvable(D)
            |    |    |    Entering solvable(null)
            |    |    |    solvable(null) returns false
            |    |    |    Entering solvable(null)
            |    |    |    solvable(null) returns false
            |    |    solvable(D) returns false
            |    solvable(A) returns false
            |    Entering solvable(B)
            |    |    Entering solvable(E)
            |    |    solvable(B) returns true
            solvable(Root) returns true
            true
    </pre><br>

    <strong>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</strong>

    <p>
        Writing debugging statements is programming too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it to debug
        the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to 
        your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example,
        you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true); and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these 
        changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.
    </p>

    <p>The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">
        <pre>
            
            static final boolean debugging = false;

            static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
                if (debugging) {
                    system.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");
                    indent = indent + "| ";
                }
            }

            static boolean yes(BinaryTree node){
                if (debugging) {
                    indent = indent.subString(3);
                    System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") return true");
                }
                return true;
            }

            static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
                if(debugging) {
                    indent = indent.subString(3);
                    System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") return false");
                }
                return false;
            }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about
        making your code larger, modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the 
        controlled code will be discarded.
    </p><br>

    <strong>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</strong>

    <p>
        If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened be sending it the message
        printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions.
        However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following
        code.
    </p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">
        <pre>
            new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above code just actrs like a 
        print statement.
    </p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(227, 221, 221); color: blue;">

    <strong>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</strong>

    <p>
        I call the following puzzle " Cindy's puzzle " for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marbles and the same number
        of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces to put the marbles in . Start with 
        the black marbles all at one end (say, the left) the while marbles all at the other end, and a free space in between.

        </tr>
        </table>

    <p>The goal is to reverse the positions of the marbles:</p>

    <table style="border: 1px solid black;" id="tabmain">
        <tr style="border: 1px solid black;">
            <td style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: gray;" id="tab1"><img src="white-ball.png"></td>

    <p>
        <b>
            The black marbles can only ,ove to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up). At each move, a 
            marble can either:
        </b>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
        <li>Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear.</li>

        The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,
        which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the 
        puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to
        print out the bad news.

        The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,

        Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board
        position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board positiona), we need only find the possible moves from that node.
        Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of 
        approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find 
        a different but equally valid approach.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump,
        it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves is possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and 
        check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require 
        having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the 
        board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a 
        particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that 
        must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a sigth 
        complicaton because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        <b>
            Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each 
            space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method can Move (int[] board, int 
            position) which determines whether a move is possible from the position:
        </b>
    </p><br>

    <ul>
        <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left;</li>
    </ul><br>

    <p>
        We write another method <b>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b> that will take a board and position, make a move form
        that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, 
        rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity). In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative"
        rather than "mutative".

        Along with <b>canMove and makeMove,</b> we are using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with meanings that should 
        be obvious.

        Notice that solution is given in reverse order. BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the rigth, as in the last 
        line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphaize this point. Backtracking always produces
        its results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again 
        to get them in the correct order.
